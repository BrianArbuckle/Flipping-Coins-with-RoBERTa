TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") was 22.4%. •Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $13.4 billion. •Income from operations was $6.4 billion.•Other income (expense), net, was a gain of $1.9 billion.•Effective tax rate was 15.9%.•Net income was $7.0 billion with diluted net income per share of $10.13.•Operating cash flow was $14.0 billion.•Capital expenditures were $5.4\\xa0billion.•Number of employees was 127,498 as of June\\xa030, 2020. The majority of new hires during the quarter were engineers and product managers. By product area, the largest headcount additions were in Google Cloud and Search.The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and OperationsIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. The macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior, and market volatility. We began to observe the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results late in the quarter ended March 31, 2020.For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year due to the continued impacts of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global economic activity. During the course of the quarter, we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, followed by increased spending by our advertisers. The decline in advertising revenues was partially offset by continued growth in Google Cloud and other non-advertising revenues.We continue to assess the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, which has been reflected in an increase in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. We experienced pressure on our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to changes in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation. In addition, market volatility has contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments, and for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 we recognized net gains on our equity investments as compared to net losses in the quarter ended March 30, 2020.While we continued to make investments in land and buildings for data centers, offices and information technology infrastructure, we have slowed the pace of our investments, primarily as it relates to office facilities.34Looking ahead, the impact of COVID-19 on our business continues to evolve and be unpredictable. For example, to the extent the pandemic continues to disrupt economic activity globally we, like other businesses, are not immune to continued adverse impacts to our business, operations and financial results from prolonged decreases in advertising spend, changes in user behavior and preferences, credit deterioration and liquidity of our customers, depressed economic activity, or volatility in capital markets. The extent of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the uneven impact to certain industries; advances in testing, treatment and prevention; the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government stimulus measures. To address the potential impact to our business, over the near-term, we continue to evaluate the pace of our investment plans, including, but not limited to, our hiring, investments in data centers, servers, network equipment, real estate and facilities, marketing and travel spending, as well as taking certain measures to support our customers, employees, and communities we operate in. The impact of COVID-19 and the extent of these measures we may implement could have a material impact on our financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially.Information about SegmentsWe operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.Our reported segments are:•Google – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.•Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X, among others.

We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.The following table presents our Google advertising revenues (in millions, unaudited):\\xa0Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Google Search & other$23,642\\xa0\\xa0$21,319\\xa0\\xa0$46,189\\xa0\\xa0$45,821\\xa0\\xa0YouTube ads(1)3,603\\xa0\\xa03,812\\xa0\\xa06,628\\xa0\\xa07,850\\xa0\\xa0Google Network Members\\' properties5,249\\xa0\\xa04,736\\xa0\\xa010,264\\xa0\\xa09,959\\xa0\\xa0Google advertising$32,494\\xa0\\xa0$29,867\\xa0\\xa0$63,081\\xa0\\xa0$63,630\\xa0\\xa0Google advertising revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues84.0\\xa0%78.6\\xa0%84.4\\xa0%80.6\\xa0%(1)\\xa0YouTube non-advertising revenues are included in Google other revenues.Google advertising revenues are generated on our Google properties (including Google Search & other properties and YouTube) and Google Network Members’ properties. Google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:•Google Search & other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.) and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;•YouTube ads consists of revenues generated primarily on YouTube properties; and•Google Network Members\\' properties consist of revenues generated primarily on Google Network Members\\' properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.Google Search & other Our Google Search & other revenues decreased $2,323 million and $368 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19. Beginning in March of 2020, the effects of COVID-19 on both desktop and mobile search led to a decline in revenues when, despite an increase in user search activity, our revenues were adversely affected by a shift to less commercial topics and reduced advertiser spending. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, followed by increased spending by our advertisers. The decrease in revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 was partially offset by the revenue growth we experienced prior to the impact of COVID-19.YouTube adsYouTube ads revenues increased $209 million and $1,222 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase was driven by our direct response advertising products, which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending. This increase was partially offset by a decline in revenues for our brand advertising products driven by reduced advertiser spending due to the impact of COVID-19.36Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Google Network Members\\' propertiesOur Google Network Members\\' properties revenues decreased $513 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in revenues for Google Ad Manager and AdSense due to reduced advertiser spending driven by the impact of COVID-19.Our Google Network Members\\' properties revenues decreased $305 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by a decline in revenues for Google Ad Manager and AdSense due to reduced advertiser spending driven by the impact of COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues for AdMob. Use of Monetization MetricsPaid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com and other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads (certain YouTube ad formats are not included in our click or impression based metrics). Impressions for our Google Network Members\\' properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members\\' properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager.Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our Google properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our Google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on Google Network Members’ properties.Google propertiesThe following table presents changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Paid clicks change28\\xa0%8\\xa0%33\\xa0%10\\xa0%Cost-per-click change(11)%(15)%(15)%(10)%The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 due to an increase in paid clicks driven by growth in views of YouTube engagement ads; an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. This growth was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19, which led to a shift to less commercial search activity and a reduction in advertiser spending. During the three months ended June 30, 2020 we began to observe a recovery in paid clicks as user search activity gradually returned to more commercial topics, followed by increased spending by our advertisers. The overall positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by a mix shift to less commercial topics and reduced advertiser spending in response to COVID-19. In addition, the decrease in cost-per-click was also driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms.37Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Google Network Members\\' propertiesThe following table presents changes in our impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Impressions change11\\xa0%16\\xa0%8\\xa0%14\\xa0%Cost-per-impression change(1)%(23)%—\\xa0%(15)%Impressions increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in AdManager. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in impressions was offset by a decrease in the cost-per-impression paid by our advertisers largely due to a reduction in advertiser spending in response to COVID-19.

The growth was primarily driven by Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. Growth for Google Play was primarily driven by sales of apps and in-app purchases, and growth for YouTube subscriptions was primarily driven by an increase in paid subscribers. The increase was partially offset by a decline in hardware revenues.38Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Over time, our growth rate for Google Cloud and Google other revenues may be affected by the seasonality associated with new product and service launches, as well as market dynamics.

Our international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.39Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.The following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages, unaudited):\\xa0Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,2019202020192020EMEA revenues$12,313\\xa0\\xa0$11,363\\xa0\\xa0$23,981\\xa0\\xa0$24,208\\xa0\\xa0Exclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates816\\xa0\\xa0361\\xa0\\xa01,578\\xa0\\xa0596\\xa0\\xa0EMEA constant currency revenues$13,129\\xa0\\xa0$11,724\\xa0\\xa0$25,559\\xa0\\xa0$24,804\\xa0\\xa0Prior period EMEA revenues$10,888\\xa0\\xa0$12,313\\xa0\\xa0$21,579\\xa0\\xa0$23,981\\xa0\\xa0EMEA revenue percentage change13\\xa0%(8)%11\\xa0%1\\xa0%EMEA constant currency revenue percentage change21\\xa0%(5)%18\\xa0%3\\xa0%APAC revenues$6,536\\xa0\\xa0$6,945\\xa0\\xa0$12,632\\xa0\\xa0$14,183\\xa0\\xa0Exclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates217\\xa0\\xa0105\\xa0\\xa0416\\xa0\\xa0166\\xa0\\xa0APAC constant currency revenues$6,753\\xa0\\xa0$7,050\\xa0\\xa0$13,048\\xa0\\xa0$14,349\\xa0\\xa0Prior period APAC revenues$5,090\\xa0\\xa0$6,536\\xa0\\xa0$9,909\\xa0\\xa0$12,632\\xa0\\xa0APAC revenue percentage change28\\xa0%6\\xa0%27\\xa0%12\\xa0%APAC constant currency revenue percentage change33\\xa0%8\\xa0%32\\xa0%14\\xa0%Other Americas revenues$2,124\\xa0\\xa0$1,839\\xa0\\xa0$4,030\\xa0\\xa0$3,996\\xa0\\xa0Exclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates184\\xa0\\xa0240\\xa0\\xa0376\\xa0\\xa0336\\xa0\\xa0Other Americas constant currency revenues$2,308\\xa0\\xa0$2,079\\xa0\\xa0$4,406\\xa0\\xa0$4,332\\xa0\\xa0Prior period Other Americas revenues$1,849\\xa0\\xa0$2,124\\xa0\\xa0$3,580\\xa0\\xa0$4,030\\xa0\\xa0Other Americas revenue percentage change15\\xa0%(13)%13\\xa0%(1)%Other Americas constant currency revenue percentage change25\\xa0%(2)%23\\xa0%7\\xa0%United States revenues$17,863\\xa0\\xa0$17,999\\xa0\\xa0$34,395\\xa0\\xa0$36,869\\xa0\\xa0United States revenue percentage change20\\xa0%1\\xa0%18\\xa0%7\\xa0%Hedging gains$108\\xa0\\xa0$151\\xa0\\xa0$245\\xa0\\xa0$200\\xa0\\xa0Total revenues$38,944\\xa0\\xa0$38,297\\xa0\\xa0$75,283\\xa0\\xa0$79,456\\xa0\\xa0Total constant currency revenues$40,053\\xa0\\xa0$38,852\\xa0\\xa0$77,408\\xa0\\xa0$80,354\\xa0\\xa0Prior period revenues, excluding hedging effect(1)$32,760\\xa0\\xa0$38,836\\xa0\\xa0$64,145\\xa0\\xa0$75,038\\xa0\\xa0Total revenue percentage change19\\xa0%(2)%18\\xa0%6\\xa0%Total constant currency revenue percentage change22\\xa0%0\\xa0%21\\xa0%7\\xa0%(1)\\xa0Total revenues and hedging (losses) were $32,657 million and $(103) million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $63,803 million and $(342)\\xa0million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.Our EMEA revenue percentage change from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Euro and British pound. Our APAC revenue percentage change from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to Australian dollar and South Korean won, partially offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen.40Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Our Other Americas revenue percentage change from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real. Our Other Americas revenue percentage change from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Argentine peso.Costs and ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members\\' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’ properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:•Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review and customer support costs). These costs are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate with related changes in revenues; and•Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.The following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020TAC$7,238\\xa0\\xa0$6,694\\xa0\\xa0$14,098\\xa0\\xa0$14,146\\xa0\\xa0Other cost of revenues10,058\\xa0\\xa011,859\\xa0\\xa019,210\\xa0\\xa023,389\\xa0\\xa0Total cost of revenues$17,296\\xa0\\xa0$18,553\\xa0\\xa0$33,308\\xa0\\xa0$37,535\\xa0\\xa0Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues44.4\\xa0%48.4\\xa0%44.2\\xa0%47.2\\xa0%Cost of revenues increased $1,257 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in other cost of revenues $1,801 million which was partially offset by a decrease in TAC of $544 million. Cost of revenues increased $4,227 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues of $4,179 million and TAC of  $48 million, respectively.The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs and an increase in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube consistent with the growth in YouTube revenues. This increase was partially offset by a decline in hardware costs.TAC decreased from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020 due to decreases in TAC paid to Google Network Members and to distribution partners, primarily driven by a decrease in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate increased from 22.3% to 22.4% from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in the TAC rate on Google properties revenues due to the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. This increase was partially offset by the favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members’ properties to Google properties. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020.41Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.TAC increased from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners which was partially offset by a decrease in TAC paid to Google Network Members. The increase in TAC paid to distribution partners was due to both an increase in revenues subject to TAC and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The decrease in TAC paid to Google Network Members was primarily due to a decrease in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 22.3% to 22.2% from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members\\' properties to Google properties. The TAC rate on Google properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020.Over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:•The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, product mix, revenue share terms, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies;•The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members\\' properties;•Certain costs that are less variable in nature and may not correlate with the related revenues;•Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search and YouTube and other products;•Content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription revenues; •Costs related to hardware sales; and•Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.Research and DevelopmentThe following table presents our R&D expenses (in millions, unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Research and development expenses$6,213\\xa0\\xa0$6,875\\xa0\\xa0$12,242\\xa0\\xa0$13,695\\xa0\\xa0Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues16.0\\xa0%18.0\\xa0%16.3\\xa0%17.2\\xa0%R&D expenses consist primarily of:•Compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services; •Depreciation expenses; •Equipment-related expenses; and•Professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.R&D expenses increased $662 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $689 million, largely resulting from a 12% increase in headcount.R&D expenses increased $1,453 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $1,376 million, largely resulting from a 15% increase in headcount.Over time, R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenues. In addition, R&D expenses may be affected by a number of factors including continued investment in ads, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, machine learning, Other Bets, Search and YouTube.42Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Sales and MarketingThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses (in millions, unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Sales and marketing expenses$4,212\\xa0\\xa0$3,901\\xa0\\xa0$8,117\\xa0\\xa0$8,401\\xa0\\xa0Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues10.8\\xa0%10.2\\xa0%10.8\\xa0%10.6\\xa0%Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:•Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and•Compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions.Sales and marketing expenses decreased $311 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional expenses of $419 million as we paused or rescheduled campaigns and changed some events to digital-only formats as a result of COVID-19.Over time, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenues. In addition, sales and marketing expenses may be affected by a number of factors including the seasonality associated with new product and service launches and strategic decisions regarding the timing and extent of our spending.General and AdministrativeThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses (in millions, unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020General and administrative expenses$2,043\\xa0\\xa0$2,585\\xa0\\xa0$4,131\\xa0\\xa0$5,465\\xa0\\xa0General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues5.2\\xa0%6.7\\xa0%5.5\\xa0%6.9\\xa0%General and administrative expenses consist primarily of:•Compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs for employees in our finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations; •Depreciation;•Equipment-related expenses;•Legal-related expenses; and •Professional services fees primarily related to audit, information technology consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.General and administrative expenses increased $542 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $197 million, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase of $124 million in charitable contributions primarily related to our response to COVID-19 and an increase of $91 million related to allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable.  General and administrative expenses increased $1,334 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020. $538 million of the increase was due to an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount.

The EC decision imposed a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) fine, which was accrued in the first quarter of 2019. Please refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetThe following table presents other income (expense), net (in millions, unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months Ended\\xa0June 30,June 30,\\xa02019202020192020Other income (expense), net$2,967\\xa0\\xa0$1,894\\xa0\\xa0$4,505\\xa0\\xa0$1,674\\xa0\\xa0Other income (expense), net, decreased $1,073 million from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily driven by decreases in unrealized gains on equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in accrued performance fees. Other income (expense), net, decreased $2,831 million from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The change was primarily driven by decreases in unrealized gains, including impairments, on equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in accrued performance fees.Over time, other income (expense), net, may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including the effects of COVID-19, could result in a significant change in the value of our investments. Fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue to, contribute to volatility of OI&E in future periods. For additional information about our investments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate; unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,2019202020192020Provision for income taxes$2,200\\xa0\\xa0$1,318\\xa0\\xa0$3,689\\xa0\\xa0$2,239\\xa0\\xa0Effective tax rate18.1\\xa0%15.9\\xa0%18.2\\xa0%14.0\\xa0%Our effective tax rate decreased 2.2% from the three months ended June 30, 2019 to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation related tax benefits including the reversal of the Altera tax benefit as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, and an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax benefit, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain of our Other Bets. Our effective tax rate decreased 4.2% from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax benefit and stock-based compensation related tax benefits including the reversal of the Altera tax benefit as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in 2019 that did not recur in 2020, partially offset by an 44Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.increase in valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain of our Other Bets. Our effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may fluctuate through the rest of the year, in particular due to COVID-19. As such, evolving facts and circumstances surrounding these forecasts could result in the application of different provisions of tax laws and cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to change significantly through the remainder of the year. In addition, our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates, the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Capital Resources and LiquidityAs of June\\xa030, 2020, we had $121.1\\xa0billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.As of\\xa0June\\xa030, 2020, we had long-term taxes payable of\\xa0$6.5 billion\\xa0related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7\\xa0billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1\\xa0billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7\\xa0billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.In November 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $7.35 per share, representing a total purchase price of approximately $2.1\\xa0billion as of the date of the agreement. The acquisition of Fitbit is expected to be completed later this year, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.In July 2020, we announced the Google for India Digitization Fund to help accelerate India’s digital economy. In addition, we announced our first transaction of the fund in which we entered into an agreement to invest approximately INR 33,737 crore ($4.5\\xa0billion as of July 15, 2020) in Jio Platforms Ltd. for a 7.7% stake in the company. This agreement is subject to regulatory review in India and is expected to be completed later this year.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0\\xa0billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June\\xa030, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of June\\xa030, 2020, we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2023 with no amounts outstanding. The interest rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of June\\xa030, 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $4.0 billion.In July 2019 the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $25.0 billion of its Class C capital stock. As of June 30, 2020, $5.4 billion remains available for repurchase. In July 2020, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $28.0 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.45Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.During the six months ended June 30, 2020 we spent $11.4\\xa0billion on capital expenditures and recognized total operating lease assets of $1.4 billion. As of June\\xa030, 2020, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $14.4 billion. Finance leases were not material for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the leases.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions, unaudited):\\xa0Six Months EndedJune 30,\\xa020192020Net cash provided by operating activities$24,627\\xa0\\xa0$25,444\\xa0\\xa0Net cash used in investing activities$(15,843)\\xa0$(10,295)\\xa0Net cash used in financing activities$(8,929)\\xa0$(15,684)\\xa0Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesOur largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network Members\\' properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the net impact of increases in cash received from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for compensation expenses accrued as of December 31, 2019.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property and equipment, which primarily includes our investments in land and buildings for data centers, offices and information technology infrastructure to provide capacity for the growth of our businesses; purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities; and payments for acquisitions.Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to a net increase in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of marketable securities.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net payments related to stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and repayments of debt.Net cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2019 to the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of capital stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019, certain of which are further described below. As of June 30, 2020 the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold and as a result, certain of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility that could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods.46Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our interim tax accruals are based on an estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income along with certain discrete items recorded in the period. Estimates of the annual effective tax rate at the end of an interim period are based on our best estimate of future events and transactions which, as a result of COVID-19, may be impacted by a higher degree of variability and volatility. As such, evolving facts and circumstances surrounding these forecasts could result in the application of different provisions of tax laws and cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to change significantly through the remainder of the year.Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.Available InformationOur website is located at\\xa0www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at\\xa0www.abc.xyz/investor.

Due to financial market movements in fiscal year 2020 and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of COVID-19, we are providing an update to the disclosures made in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of June\\xa030, 2020.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar,\\xa0Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.47Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates, it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $61 million as of June\\xa030, 2020. The adverse effect as of June\\xa030, 2020 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $808 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the three months ended June\\xa030, 2020.We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of June\\xa030, 2020, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $536 million lower as of June\\xa030, 2020. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations.If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (\"CTA\") within AOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately $940 million lower as of June\\xa030, 2020. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.Interest Rate RiskOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. We use value-at-risk (\"VaR\") analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of  June 30, 2020 are shown below (in millions):As of June 30, 202012-Month Average as of June 30, 2020Risk Category - Interest Rate$140\\xa0\\xa0$109\\xa0\\xa0Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of June 30, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.Equity Investment RiskOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.48Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $4.5 billion of our investments as of June 30, 2020. A hypothetical adverse price change of 30%, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity securities by $1.3 billion.Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. As of June\\xa030, 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $11.3 billion. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-marketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. Additionally, observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities. The effect of COVID-19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.The carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of June\\xa030, 2020, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.For further information about our equity investments, please refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.<span '"

# Flipping-Coins-with-RoBERTa
### Final project for Stanford XCS224U - Natural Language Understanding 

This paper shows an application of transformer models (RoBERTa) to predict stock market movement. Our research efforts focused on extracting the financial 'sentiment' of stock-price performance by leveraging company filings. We used the SEC data to train our model and used the equal weighted NASDAQ 100 index as our benchmark. Recognizing the strengths of a sentiment classification task, we adopted stock-performance as a proxy for 'sentiment.' This predicted stock outcomes compared to the market index. Our initial success came from removing noise in the form of boilerplate text. Next, we chose logistic regression and the Naive Bayes classification model on smaller data sets with iterative optimization for the testing model. Finally, we ran our original system with RoBERTa for stock price performance 'sentiment' predictions. We found that transformer and traditional machine learning approaches produced suboptimal results that are on par with a random guess, which is why we included our cheeky coin toss results. The real challenge, as our research confirmed, came from the sentiment free tone used in the company filings.
